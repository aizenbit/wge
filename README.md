# Worst Game Ever

Another project for self-education. I had wanted to try C++11, learn procedural generation, AI, genetic algorithms and some cool stuff.

This is a very simple and boring turn-based game, in which player fights against the same enemies on procedurally created maps. Enemies can adapt to player's tactic using genetic algorithm.

Player is blue and enemies are orange. Line shows an attack. Is this better than ASCII-art? :)
